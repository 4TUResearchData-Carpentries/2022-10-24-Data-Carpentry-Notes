## Introduction

In this workshop, I learned **really cool** things! And I mean ***REALLY*** cool!

For example, we learned about **tidyverse**, using the *SAFI* dataset. The *SAFI*
dataset contains the following variables:

- village
  + Name of the village
- interview_date
- no_members
  + How many family members in a house
- years_liv
- respondent_wall_type
- rooms
